This repository contains projects I've worked on for Projects in Machine Learning & AI, a class I'm taking. 

Each project is almost entirely open-ended. 
We're assigned a model or models to use, then it's up to us to pick a problem, a [publicly available] dataset, and to research and implement our solution. 

Of the projects, I'm most proud of homework 5. In it, I experimented with some data engineering, built a couple CNNs, practiced clean+readable programming, and came out with a good result.

Some of these implementations [HWs 1,3,4] have been failures, a poor problem or dataset choice meant a failed model. Each of those were a learning experience! And I've learned a lot from these failures.  ML is a tool, each architecture can only be pushed so far. I've gained a better sense for how to apply these -- what their strengths are, where their limitations lie -- through these failures, as well as a better understanding of data engineering.
